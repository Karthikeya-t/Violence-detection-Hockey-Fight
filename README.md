# Violence-detection-Hockey-Fight

I consider Hockey Fights dataset 1[](http://visilab.etsii.uclm.es/personas/oscar/FightDetection/HockeyFights.zip) and improved its accuracy upto 0.96.
My main idea is to use the latest transformer model - MobileVit. 
I took the previous model of VGG + Lstm paper![](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/hockey-fight-detection-dataset) and replaced VGG with Mobile Vit, but when I replaced VGG with a mobile net then it gave great accuracy.
